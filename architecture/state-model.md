The **SQLite DB is the single source of configuration.** There is no
`config.json` per agent and no stored `state` column; an agent's **live state**
(`running` / `idle` / `stopped` / `error`) is **computed** from the DB config
plus what is actually running, not persisted.

A running iteration also has persisted AI-proxy liveness evidence. Its
`started_at` time is the initial activity point, and every authenticated request
for that exact agent and iteration updates `last_ai_request_at` before upstream
work begins. When the newest point is at least the agent's positive
`ai_stall_timeout_s` old (300 seconds by default), live state is derived as
`error` with an informational `error_reason`; the loop and iteration continue.
The next attributed request updates the timestamp and live state derives as
`running` again. Stale requests for older or completed iterations are ignored.

Reconciliation and reaping are therefore flag-independent: the daemon derives
what *should* be running from the DB and converges to it.

## Filesystem-backed shell scripts

The global pre-iteration script at `<base-dir>/global-agent-shell.sh` and an
agent script at `<base-dir>/agents/<name>/agent-shell.sh` are intentionally not
SQLite fields. The daemon validates a complete submitted value with `bash -n`
before atomically replacing an owner-only file. A rejected value leaves the
previous file unchanged; a missing or empty file is a no-op at launch.

## Pricing and Usage snapshots

Model-price state has three layers with distinct ownership. Operator-managed
and LiteLLM-managed rows live in `ai_pricing`; built-in prices are runtime
fallbacks rather than persisted manual overrides. The resolved in-memory map is
derived with `manual` rows first, then `litellm` rows, then the built-in
fallback. `model-prices-litellm.json` is a rebuildable cache of the external
source, not a second editable configuration store. A valid cache is reconciled
into the managed database rows during startup before its complete generation is
published to the proxy.

Each `ai_requests` row is historical evidence, not a projection of current
configuration. The proxy calculates `cost_usd` once from one complete price
generation and persists that value with mutually exclusive input, output,
cache-write, and cache-read token buckets. Later price refreshes do not
recalculate Usage or budget history.

The same row stores nullable request-time `group_id` and `group_name` snapshots.
Moving an agent, renaming or deleting a group, or changing current membership
does not rewrite those columns. Rows created before snapshots existed remain
null and appear as Ungrouped; reindexing an old transcript does not guess a
group from current state. See [AI proxy and audit](/docs/architecture/ai-proxy#group-snapshots-and-usage)
for the recording and filtering flow and [Images and groups](/docs/images-and-groups#historical-group-usage)
for the operator-visible consequences.

## Recorded halt reasons

The loop can be turned off automatically as well as by hand: a stop policy
(`on_error` or `on_timeout` set to `stop`) halts it after a failed or timed-out
iteration, and the idle limit halts it after enough consecutive self-declared
idle iterations. The reason is already persisted in two existing columns — a
policy halt in `error_reason`, an idle stop as a `status_message` carrying the
shared `idle_limit` prefix — so no new column and no migration stand behind it.
A derived accessor computes a halt kind and reason from those two fields,
because both can be populated at once; an error halt wins over an idle stop,
being the more urgent explanation. All three agent read surfaces — `agent
inspect`, the `agent ps` rows, and the agent status endpoint — report it as
`halt_kind` (`error` or `idle_limit`) and `halt_reason`, and only when there is
a reason: with none, both keys are omitted entirely rather than emitted empty.
An agent-authored status line is never reported as a halt reason, since only
the idle prefix qualifies.

## Iteration tags

An iteration row is immutable evidence of an execution, so tags are not a column
on it. They are rows in `iteration_tags`, keyed by `(iteration_id, tag)`, with an
`ON DELETE CASCADE` reference to `iterations`. Retention pruning and agent
deletion therefore retire an iteration's tags with the iteration itself, and no
tag write can touch the iteration row.

A batch of tag changes over several iterations of one agent commits in one
transaction, and an id belonging to another agent fails the whole batch rather
than writing part of it. Tags are a property of the iteration, not of the agent
that applied them: who tagged an iteration is not recorded.

## Chats and participants

A chat is persisted state, not a view over the bus. `chats` holds one row per
chat — `id`, `kind`, `title`, the one transport `channel` it owns, an optional
`legacy_agent`, `created_at` and `archived_at` — and `chat_participants` holds
one row per principal in it, keyed by `(chat_id, principal)`, with its `role`,
`joined_at`, `read_ts` and `muted` flag. The `channel` column is unique, so two
chats can never address the same transport channel.

Ownership follows how the chat came to exist. The daemon owns the three chats
it provisions for every agent — `dm:<agent>`, `tasks:<agent>` and
`service:<agent>` — reconciling them at startup and at agent creation, which
makes them self-healing: a missing row is recreated, and the namespaces they
live in are refused to anyone else. A chat the customer creates is owned by the
customer: nothing reconciles it, and its lifetime is exactly its row.

Membership is durable and revocable, and its lifetime is not the delivery's.
Adding an agent participant materializes its locked subscription to the chat
channel; removing one sets `subscriptions.revoked_at` instead of deleting the
row, because `deliveries` joins `subscriptions` and a delete would make the
agent's already-created, unacknowledged deliveries vanish from its queue.
A revoked subscription is skipped by fan-out and still owns its past deliveries.

The invariant underneath all of it: **`messages` rows are never rewritten.**
No chat operation re-channels, edits or deletes a published message. That is
what lets pre-chats history stay readable without a data migration — a personal
chat carries `legacy_agent`, and its feed unions the chat channel with the old
projection of `agent:<a>:inbox` and `user:<customer>` merged by time — and it is
why a chat can be created, joined and left without risking history.

## Customer identity and read marks

`customer_login` in `daemon_config` is the fixed customer login, defaulted to
`customer` and adopted once — with existing tasks, comments, waits, notification
state and the old `user:<$USER>` channel carried over in the same transaction —
instead of following whichever account runs `tariboyd`. Read marks are
`chat_participants.read_ts`, one per participant, and only ever move forward;
the single pre-chats `chat_read_v1` JSON object in `daemon_config` was carried
into those rows by the chats migration. A read mark is UI state rather than
authority: losing one costs an unread count, not a message.

## Message queue state

Queue saturation is derived rather than persisted. The agent status endpoint
counts distinct message IDs across that agent's unacknowledged, non-DLQ
deliveries and returns `messages_pending`, the configured
`messages_max_queue`, and `messages_queue_full`. The flag is true when the
pending count is at or above the limit. Publish limiting, status, and physical
queue clearing use the same delivery predicate so the UI never maintains a
second estimate.

## Native task state

Each agent row persists `goal_enabled` (default true), a positive
`goal_wait_customer_timeout_s` (default 300), a positive
`goal_delivery_cooldown_s` (default 60), daemon-owned
`last_goal_delivery_at`, and its read-only `current_goal_task_key`. Disabling
Goal clears the selected key; re-enabling it selects from current task state
rather than restoring an old choice. The goal reconciler normally owns
selection; an agent may explicitly select an active task assigned to itself
during a live iteration. Manually blocked tasks and tasks with an active
incoming `blocks` relation are not eligible; a selected task is released if it
becomes blocked. Only the reconciler writes the delivery timestamp.

Task queues, the unlimited parent tree, comments, waits, relations, events,
notification outbox, customer notification state, and mutation idempotency
records are normalized tables in the same `tariboyd.db`. A task key is its
queue prefix plus four random characters (`TEST-fkt3`), minted against the
`task_key` UNIQUE constraint rather than a counter, and it never changes when a
task moves between parents or between daemons. `task_key_aliases` holds the
numeric keys retired by that migration so they keep resolving; the daemon
rewrites any remaining numeric key at start, in one transaction that also
rewrites `agents.current_goal_task_key`. `task_queues.next_number` is left in
the schema but is no longer read or advanced. Recursive
CTEs derive descendants, inherited access, blocking cycles, and active
descendants without a configured depth limit.

Priority is persisted as a constrained `P0` through `P3` value and defaults to
`P2`. Every root or nested sibling set has canonical order `(priority,
position, task key)`. Manual positions are normalized within a priority bucket,
so reparenting preserves priority without disturbing other buckets.

Every task mutation, its event, and any notification intent commit in one
SQLite transaction. The channel publisher runs afterward from the durable
outbox with a stable message idempotency key. The WebSocket is only a delivery
optimization: `task_events.sequence` is the resume authority and HTTP queries
remain authoritative. See [Native Tasks](/docs/tasks).

Managed queues add normalized workflow definitions/bindings/pools, immutable
status and requirement executions, assignment attempts and leases, artifacts,
questions/holds, subscriptions/observations, idempotency rows, and a workflow
outbox. A task snapshots the active published version at creation; later queue
activation or pool rebinding cannot rewrite its history. Startup reconciles
expired leases, question deadlines, pending workflow outbox rows, and the
persisted bus-ingress cursor. See [Configurable task workflows](/docs/task-workflows).

## Image assignment state

User Store registrations belong to each daemon's SQLite database and persist
only their unique name and source. Git clones live under
`<base-dir>/stores/<name>/`; local absolute sources stay in place. Image names,
versions, and diagnostics are read from `images/` on disk for every view, never
stored as a second inventory. Store refresh and build preparation are
serialized so a pull cannot race source freezing. Store builds then use the
ordinary image snapshot and publication path below.

Directories left under `<base-dir>/store/versions/` by an older release are
untouched legacy data. Current daemons neither read nor refresh them.

Each agent row owns an active image ref/digest and a separate pending
ref/digest/error. Selecting another image changes only the pending fields. The
iteration launch gate validates and stages that artifact, reconciles image
capabilities, and promotes active plus pending state in one guarded transaction.
Every new iteration snapshots its image ref, source `image_version` when
present, digest, and prompt-template hash, so later switches cannot rewrite
historical execution identity. Historical iterations and legacy images keep an
empty version instead of inheriting the ref's current value.

The agent row remains authoritative during crash recovery. An incomplete local
image swap is either rolled back to the DB-active backup or completed when the
already-promoted image digest matches the row. Each unpacked image records the
ref it was materialized for and a daemon-owned id marker, so two generations of
one ref cannot be confused. Generations are kept by id under
`images/<name>/refs/`, so active and pending assignments survive a moved tag.
Harness, model, effort, environment, CWD, context, workdir, messages, history,
group, and subscriptions are not image assignment fields.

Image content is addressed by ref id — derived from the image name and the
source `image_version`, or from the archive bytes when no version is declared —
and a tag is a pointer file naming that id. One build publishes one ref and
moves every requested tag onto it, so a versioned tag and `latest` always agree.
The build records where those tags pointed, then commits every source snapshot
and provenance row in one SQLite transaction; a failure restores the tags and
deletes only content the build introduced, never a generation an agent may be
pinned to. There is no separate immutable mode and no publication journal:
rebuilding any non-reserved ref is always allowed, so no build path can be
refused for a ref that already exists. A store written before this model is
migrated once at daemon startup, keeping each archive's content digest as its
ref id so pinned digests keep resolving.
One publication gate spans ordinary, editable-source, team-import,
agent-authored, compose, and controlled-release publication plus assignment,
activation, provisioning, reprovisioning, import, and removal, so none can
persist an uncommitted generation. Compose publishes through the daemon rather
than writing its image store from the client process.

## Restart handoff

A running iteration is owned by `tariboy-shim`, not by the lifetime of the
daemon process. During a graceful daemon restart, cancellation detaches the old
engine observer without changing the durable iteration row from `running`.
Before any of that, the replacement daemon reconciles each stored agent's bin
shims against its active image (see
[Agent bin shims](/docs/architecture#agent-bin-shims)), so adopted work
continues with the launchers pinned by that image.
The replacement daemon enumerates live shim sockets before starting loop
engines, adopts each matching iteration, and finalizes the existing row when
`result.json` appears. It never launches a duplicate shim while adoption is in
progress.

Pending adoptions are also registered as current live iterations inside the
replacement manager. Terminal attach, resize, input, screen, and Kill RPCs
therefore continue to reach the original shim before the normal loop engine is
created. Start remains idempotent during this window, direct Exec cannot bypass
the adoption barrier, and post-adoption startup reloads the current persisted
Enabled value instead of using a pre-restart snapshot. Restart records one
replacement interactive-run intent until handoff completes, even when
Autopilot is disabled; the engine consumes that intent through a launch gate
shared with Stop, so a later Stop can cancel work that has not started. The gate
is acquired after external tmux checks and covers the durable launch or
manual-collision outcome. If Stop then races detached process creation, the
runner uses bounded cooperative shim Kill so the shim stops its owned harness
process group or tmux session. An unreachable interactive shim receives an
explicit tmux kill. The final managed fallback signals the spawned shim to
force-kill its separately owned non-interactive harness group, then escalates
against the outer shim group after a short bound. This cleanup is skipped when
the row is still `running` for daemon handoff. Shim connections are acquired
under the handoff lock with a finite dial timeout, preventing a pending control
operation from crossing into a replacement iteration when the stable socket
pathname is reused without allowing a wedged listener to block lifecycle
operations indefinitely.

The durable completion flag follows the same lifecycle on both sides of a
restart. Once an adopted iteration calls `i-am-done`, the replacement manager
allows the harness a two-second grace period to exit naturally, then sends the
shim exactly one cooperative Kill request if no `result.json` has appeared.
The shim writes the result and adoption finalizes the original row, preserving
the productive or `--idle` declaration recorded with the completion flag.

The AI-proxy endpoint and active per-iteration leases are carried through the
same restart, so harness retries reconnect after the short listener outage.
If the old shim is no longer reachable, adoption is the component that
terminally classifies the stale row as `harness_error`.

:::danger[This is why test daemons must be isolated]
Two daemons pointed at the same base dir share the same DB and loop managers and
will double-run each other's agents — double-executed iterations and reaped
sessions. Always isolate a test daemon with its own base dir, runtime dir, and
the web UI disabled. See [Development → Isolation](/docs/development#isolation).
