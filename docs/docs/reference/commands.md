# tariboy command reference

tariboy has three command surfaces:

1. **Operator commands** — `tariboy <group> <command>` (`sa` below is a
   convenience alias you define yourself, e.g. `alias sa=tariboy`; the build
   ships no such symlink), run by a
   human or CI against the daemon. Global flags: `--json`, `--help`,
   `--help-json`, `--version`. This is the authoritative list, generated from the
   binary's registry (`tariboy --help-json`).
2. **Agent capability scripts** — the applicable packaged skill's
   `scripts/*.sh` launcher, run *inside* an agent over `$TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET`.
3. **Native Tasks** — `tariboy-tasks`, installed as `ttasks`, runs shared task
   verbs for an operator or an identity-bound agent. `ttasks --version` reports
   its build and `ttasks --json …` requests JSON output.

`judge review` creates one bounded run for only the listed terminal iteration
IDs. It uses the lead and workers from the active Judge configuration even when
its cron schedule is disabled; it does not enable agents or loops. One worker
reviews each iteration by default. `--judges-per-iteration` must be between one
and the number of configured workers. Unknown, nonterminal, or empty selections
and invalid configured roles are rejected without creating a run.

The command pins each eligible worker's image ref, resolved digest, and
prompt-template hash with the run. Results are
evidence-backed assessments, not calibrated probabilities: confidence values
express the judge's support from the available evidence and must not be read as
measured error rates. When every independent review is `uncertain`, consensus
remains `uncertain`; missing evidence is not a disagreement or a failure.

## Agent capability scripts

Run inside an agent; the socket comes from `$TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET`.

| Tool | Purpose |

| `scripts/whoami.sh` | Print agent, cwd and current iteration |
| `scripts/status.sh` | Print the agent status |
| `scripts/loop.sh done` | Signal this iteration is finished (i-am-done) |
| `scripts/context.sh get` | Print the durable working memory (CONTEXT.md) |
| `scripts/context.sh set <text>` | Overwrite the durable working memory |
| `scripts/messages.sh message send --channel C [--type T] [--subject k=v,…] [--text … \| --data JSON]` | Publish a message to a channel |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel subscribe C [--matcher JSON] [--type globs]` | Subscribe to a channel |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel unsubscribe ID` | Remove a subscription |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel ls` | List your subscriptions |
| `scripts/messages.sh sources` | List available channels |
| `scripts/schedule.sh add --kind cron\|oneshot --spec S [--channel C] [--message JSON]` | Schedule a future wake-up |
| `scripts/schedule.sh ls` | List your schedules |
| `scripts/schedule.sh cancel ID` | Cancel a schedule |
| `scripts/scripts.sh ls` | List your scripts |
| `scripts/scripts.sh run NAME [--description TEXT] -- COMMAND` | Queue exactly one local run |
| `scripts/scripts.sh schedule NAME --every SECONDS [--quiet-exit CODE] -- COMMAND` | Run now and repeat after each completion |
| `scripts/scripts.sh runs SCRIPT_ID` / `logs RUN_ID` | Inspect run history and bounded logs |
| `scripts/scripts.sh rerun SCRIPT_ID` | Rerun a completed one-shot definition |
| `scripts/scripts.sh cancel SCRIPT_OR_RUN_ID` / `rm SCRIPT_ID` | Cancel work or remove inactive history |
| `scripts/image_creator.sh build --name NAME [--tag TAG] --path DIR` | Build a schema-v1 or schema-v2 image from an agent-confined source directory (`image-creator` only) |

## Native Tasks (`ttasks …`)

`tariboy-tasks` is the real executable and `ttasks` its managed alias. A
non-empty `TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET` selects agent mode; it uses only that socket
and fails closed if it cannot connect. Without the variable, the client uses
the host Unix daemon socket as the customer actor. The bare `tasks` command is
only the optional capability-controlled legacy agent shim.

These shared verbs are available in both modes; in agent mode every mutation
derives identity from the socket.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ttasks mine` | List visible tasks |
| `ttasks ready [--queue Q] [--claim]` | List ready work; `--claim` requires agent mode |
| `ttasks show KEY` | Show task detail, comments, waits, and relations |
| `ttasks create --queue Q --title T [--assignee A]` | Create a queue-root task |
| `ttasks create --parent KEY --title T` | Create a child inheriting queue/context |
| `ttasks update KEY [--title T] [--description D] [--status S]` | Update fields with optimistic revision |
| `ttasks assign KEY ASSIGNEE` | Hand work to an agent name |
| `ttasks comment KEY TEXT` | Add a task comment |
| `ttasks ask KEY agent:name\|user:login TEXT` | Mention a principal and record an open answer wait |
| `ttasks move KEY [--parent KEY] [--before KEY] [--to-root]` | Reparent/reorder in the same queue |
| `ttasks block KEY --by BLOCKER` | Add a directed, cycle-checked blocking relation |
| `ttasks relate KEY OTHER` | Add a symmetric related link |
| `ttasks done KEY [--complete-anyway]` | Complete, optionally overriding active descendants |

Workflow-managed queues add an assignment-scoped surface that requires agent mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ttasks work next [--queue Q] --idempotency-key K` | Atomically claim eligible work and return its least-context packet |
| `ttasks work show ASSIGNMENT` | Refresh the current packet and revisions |
| `ttasks work complete ASSIGNMENT --outcome O ...` | Submit one declared outcome |
| `ttasks work release ASSIGNMENT ...` | Release a leased attempt |
| `ttasks artifacts add ASSIGNMENT --name N --type T ...` | Attach a required typed output |
| `ttasks artifacts show ASSIGNMENT ARTIFACT --task KEY` | Read one packet-visible artifact |
| `ttasks ask ASSIGNMENT --question Q --context C --blocking-scope S ...` | Ask a universal workflow question and optionally hold work |
| `ttasks questions ASSIGNMENT` | List questions visible in the packet |
| `ttasks answer QUESTION --assignment ASSIGNMENT --answer TEXT ...` | Answer a routed question assignment |
| `ttasks observe subscribe ASSIGNMENT PATTERN ...` | Create a policy-bounded observation subscription |
| `ttasks observe list ASSIGNMENT` | List its workflow subscriptions |
| `ttasks observe cancel ASSIGNMENT SUBSCRIPTION ...` | Cancel one subscription |

Mutations represented by `...` require current task/assignment revisions and a
stable idempotency key. Exact semantics and operator REST routes are in
[Configurable task workflows](/docs/task-workflows).

The following administration roots are operator-only and are documented by
`ttasks --help-json`: `queue` (including pools, workflow bindings, and
triggers), `workflows`, `workflow` task history and artifacts, `events`,
`principals`, and `notifications`. They are unavailable to agent mode.

Resource identifiers are positional (or named flags), for example:

```bash
ttasks queue get OPS
ttasks queue update OPS --name Operations --revision 2
ttasks workflows get review 1
ttasks workflow get OPS-1
ttasks notifications read 1
ttasks events OPS-1 --after 7 --limit 10
```

`ttasks workflows create --definition JSON` accepts a workflow definition as a
JSON object; malformed JSON and non-object values fail before contacting the
daemon. Use each administration command's `--help` for its required fields.
