# tariboy command reference

tariboy has three command surfaces:

1. **Operator commands** — `tariboy <group> <command>` (`sa` below is a
   convenience alias you define yourself, e.g. `alias sa=tariboy`; the build
   ships no such symlink), run by a
   human or CI against the daemon. Global flags: `--json`, `--help`,
   `--help-json`, `--version`. This is the authoritative list, generated from the
   binary's registry (`tariboy --help-json`).
2. **Agent capability scripts** — the applicable packaged skill's
   `scripts/*.sh` launcher, run *inside* an agent over `$TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET`.
3. **Native Tasks** — `tariboy-tasks`, installed as `ttasks`, runs shared task
   verbs for an operator or an identity-bound agent. `ttasks --version` reports
   its build and `ttasks --json …` requests JSON output.

### Host-local commands

These verbs never route through the daemon, so they are absent from the
registry listing above. They act on the host the CLI runs on and work while the
daemon is down.

| Command | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `tariboy daemon start\|stop\|restart\|status\|logs` | Control and inspect the local daemon process |
| `tariboy update [VERSION\|latest] [--force]` | Install a published release over this installer-managed installation and restart a running daemon |

`tariboy update` updates only an installer-managed `linux-x86_64` installation
and is described in [Remote hosts](/docs/remote-hosts#update-a-host-from-its-own-shell).

### Iteration tags

Tags annotate an iteration without changing it: one agent marks the iterations
of another agent it has already handled. An iteration can carry several tags.
A tag is at most 64 characters and contains no comma, whitespace, or control
character.

The three mutations take a batch of iteration ids and a batch of tags, and apply
in one transaction — the whole batch succeeds or nothing is written. An id that
belongs to another agent fails the batch with `not_found`.

```bash
tariboy iteration tag add worker --id worker-20260918T10-1 --id worker-20260918T11-2 --tag processed
tariboy iteration tag rm worker --id worker-20260918T10-1 --tag processed
tariboy iteration tag set worker --id worker-20260918T10-1 --tag processed --tag reviewed
tariboy iteration tag set worker --id worker-20260918T10-1   # no --tag clears every tag
```

`tariboy iteration ls` searches by tag and by iteration start date. `--tag`
takes a comma-separated list and matches an iteration carrying **any** of them.
Both date bounds are inclusive and accept RFC3339 or a bare `YYYY-MM-DD` day:

```bash
tariboy iteration ls worker --tag processed,reviewed
tariboy iteration ls worker --started-after 2026-09-01 --started-before 2026-09-18
```

`iteration ls` rows and `iteration inspect` both report a sorted `tags` list.

## Agent capability scripts

Run inside an agent; the socket comes from `$TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET`.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/whoami.sh` | Print agent, cwd and current iteration |
| `scripts/status.sh` | Print the agent status |
| `scripts/loop.sh done` | Signal this iteration is finished (i-am-done) |
| `scripts/context.sh get` | Print the durable working memory (CONTEXT.md) |
| `scripts/context.sh set <text>` | Overwrite the durable working memory |
| `scripts/messages.sh message send --channel C [--type T] [--subject k=v,…] [--text … \| --data JSON]` | Publish a message to a channel |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel subscribe C [--matcher JSON] [--type globs]` | Subscribe to a channel |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel unsubscribe ID` | Remove a subscription |
| `scripts/messages.sh channel ls` | List your subscriptions |
| `scripts/messages.sh sources` | List available channels |
| `scripts/schedule.sh add --kind cron\|oneshot --spec S [--channel C] [--message JSON]` | Schedule a future wake-up |
| `scripts/schedule.sh ls` | List your schedules |
| `scripts/schedule.sh cancel ID` | Cancel a schedule |
| `scripts/scripts.sh ls` | List your scripts |
| `scripts/scripts.sh run NAME [--description TEXT] -- COMMAND` | Queue exactly one local run |
| `scripts/scripts.sh schedule NAME --every SECONDS -- COMMAND` | Run now and repeat after each completion; a run that exits `111` (`TARIBOY_QUIET_EXIT`) stays quiet |
| `scripts/scripts.sh runs SCRIPT_ID` / `logs RUN_ID` | Inspect run history and bounded logs |
| `scripts/scripts.sh rerun SCRIPT_ID` | Run a completed one-shot or idle recurring definition immediately |
| `scripts/scripts.sh cancel SCRIPT_OR_RUN_ID` / `rm SCRIPT_ID` | Cancel work or remove inactive history |
| `scripts/image_creator.sh build --name NAME [--tag TAG] --path DIR` | Build a schema-v2 image from a daemon-readable source directory (`image-creator` only); relative paths start at the managed workdir |

## Native Tasks (`ttasks …`)

`tariboy-tasks` is the real executable and `ttasks` its managed alias. A
non-empty `TARIBOY_TOOLS_SOCKET` selects agent mode; it uses only that socket
and fails closed if it cannot connect. Without the variable, the client uses
the host Unix daemon socket as the customer actor. The bare `tasks` command is
only the optional capability-controlled legacy agent shim.

These shared verbs are available in both modes; in agent mode every mutation
derives identity from the socket.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ttasks mine` | List visible tasks |
| `ttasks ready [--queue Q] [--claim]` | List ready work; `--claim` requires agent mode |
| `ttasks show KEY` | Show task detail, comments, waits, and relations |
| `ttasks create --queue Q --title T [--assignee A]` | Create a queue-root task |
| `ttasks create --parent KEY --title T` | Create a child inheriting queue/context |
| `ttasks update KEY [--title T] [--description D] [--status S]` | Update fields with optimistic revision |
| `ttasks assign KEY ASSIGNEE` | Hand work to an agent name |
| `ttasks comment KEY TEXT` | Add a task comment |
| `ttasks ask KEY agent:name\|user:login TEXT` | Mention a principal and record an open answer wait |
| `ttasks move KEY [--parent KEY] [--before KEY] [--to-root]` | Reparent/reorder in the same queue |
| `ttasks block KEY --by BLOCKER` | Add a directed, cycle-checked blocking relation |
| `ttasks relate KEY OTHER` | Add a symmetric related link |
| `ttasks done KEY [--complete-anyway]` | Complete, optionally overriding active descendants |

These verbs drive a task that follows a queue's workflow image. Agent mode
sends `advance`, `request_get`, `artifact_set`, `artifact_ls`, `artifact_show`,
`workflow_get`, `workflow_runs`, and `workflow_run_log` over the identity-bound
socket; operator mode calls the REST routes as the customer.

| Command | Modes | REST route |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ttasks advance KEY --outcome NAME [--from STATUS] [--message TEXT] [--no-wait]` (`--from` refuses with `status_changed` when the task has moved on; waits for the transition's checks, polling `GET /api/tasks/{key}/workflow/requests/{id}`, unless `--no-wait`) | agent, operator | `POST /api/tasks/{key}/advance` |
| `ttasks artifacts set KEY NAME [VALUE \| --file PATH]` (stdin when absent; stored as given, up to 64 KiB) | agent, operator | `PUT /api/tasks/{key}/artifacts/{name}` |
| `ttasks artifacts ls KEY` | agent, operator | `GET /api/tasks/{key}/artifacts` |
| `ttasks artifacts show KEY NAME` | agent, operator | `GET /api/tasks/{key}/artifacts/{name}` |
| `ttasks workflow get KEY` | agent, operator | `GET /api/tasks/{key}/workflow` |
| `ttasks workflow runs KEY` (newest first) | agent, operator | `GET /api/tasks/{key}/workflow/runs` |
| `ttasks workflow log KEY RUN [--max-bytes N]` (last 64 KiB by default, at most 1 MiB; queue secrets redacted; customer and the task's holders only) | agent, operator | `GET /api/tasks/{key}/workflow/runs/{id}/log` |
| `ttasks workflow move KEY --to STATUS --reason TEXT` | operator only | `POST /api/tasks/{key}/workflow/move` |
| `ttasks workflow resume KEY --decision continue\|release` (resolves the pause of a task the daemon paused: `continue` keeps the holder and zeroes the counters; `release` takes a pool task from its holder and dispatches it to another member, or leaves it `open` and unassigned; errors `invalid_decision`, `workflow_not_paused`, `forbidden`) | operator only | `POST /api/tasks/{key}/workflow/resume` |
| `ttasks cancel KEY` | operator only | `POST /api/tasks/{key}/cancel` |
| `ttasks queue workflow set QUEUE REF [--revision N]` | operator only | `PUT /api/task-queues/{queue}/workflow` |
| `ttasks queue workflow get QUEUE` | operator only | `GET /api/task-queues/{queue}/workflow` |
| `ttasks queue workflow clear QUEUE --revision N` | operator only | `DELETE /api/task-queues/{queue}/workflow` |
| `ttasks queue secret set QUEUE KEY [--value V]` (stdin when absent, one trailing newline stripped; up to 64 KiB) | operator only | `PUT /api/task-queues/{queue}/secrets/{key}` |
| `ttasks queue secret ls QUEUE` (keys only, never values) | operator only | `GET /api/task-queues/{queue}/secrets` |
| `ttasks queue secret rm QUEUE KEY` | operator only | `DELETE /api/task-queues/{queue}/secrets/{key}` |
| `ttasks queue source ls QUEUE` | operator only | `GET /api/task-queues/{queue}/sources` |
| `ttasks queue source log QUEUE RUN [--max-bytes N]` (redacted tail, 64 KiB by default) | operator only | `GET /api/task-queues/{queue}/source-runs/{id}/log` |

On a workflow task `ttasks done`, `ttasks update --status`, and
`ttasks ready --claim` are refused with `workflow_managed`; the error lists the
status's outcomes and the `ttasks advance` form to use, with `--from` set to the current status. For an outcome that
declares checks, `ttasks advance` exits `0` when the transition applied and `1`
when a check rejected it, a check failed, the request was cancelled, or the wait
ran out; the output names the next command. `ttasks show` prints
`status` (the workflow status), `category`, and `waiting_on`. See
[Task workflows](/docs/task-workflows#script-protocol) for the scripts behind
checks and watch statuses.

The following administration roots are operator-only and are documented by
`ttasks --help-json`: `queue` (including pools and triggers; see
[Task workflows](/docs/task-workflows)), `events`, `principals`, and
`notifications`. They are unavailable to agent mode.

Resource identifiers are positional (or named flags), for example:

```bash
ttasks queue get OPS
ttasks queue update OPS --name Operations --revision 2
ttasks queue pool list OPS
ttasks notifications read 1
ttasks events OPS-1 --after 7 --limit 10
```

Use each administration command's `--help` for its required fields.
