Autopilot is the daemon-controlled iteration loop. It is independent from an
interactive terminal: either can run alone, both can be enabled, and stopping
one does not silently change the other.

## Trigger model

With Autopilot enabled, an iteration can start from:

- a configured timer interval; or
- a matching pending message delivery.

Messages are durable. Publishing creates a delivery for each matching
subscription and nudges the loop. The runner includes pending deliveries in the
next prompt. Normal completion acknowledges them; harness errors, timeouts, and
kills preserve them for bounded redelivery.

Disabling Autopilot prevents new scheduled and message-triggered iterations. It
does not delete pending messages and does not terminate an interactive Console.

## Configure conservatively

Start with:

- an image prompt that defines one coherent unit of work;
- a long enough interval to inspect outcomes;
- a soft timeout that fits normal work;
- a hard timeout that bounds the worst case;
- a low cost budget;
- no external subscriptions until the timer path is understood.

The Autopilot tab shows live enablement and policy. Activity shows trigger,
iteration state, result, deadlines, audit, usage, and cost. For Claude and
Codex harnesses, the audit is presented as a readable timeline of messages,
reasoning, commands, skills, tool calls, and results; model and token metadata
remains available on each AI call. A running soft deadline may be extended only
before timeout enforcement starts.

## Controls

- **Console Exec** — start one manual iteration immediately, whether Autopilot
  is enabled or paused. It is available for both interactive and
  non-interactive agents; optional one-shot text is appended only to that
  iteration's assembled prompt.
- **Pause / Disable Autopilot** — prevent new autonomous iterations.
- **Kill** — immediately stop current iteration or session; use when work is
  unsafe or stuck.
- **Budget** — reject AI calls once the configured spend limit is reached.
- **Policy rules** — constrain models and request rates by global, agent, or
  group scope.
- **Audit** — inspect each proxied AI request and tool timeline. Copy readable
  Markdown or export a ZIP for the selected iteration or all retained
  iterations. Exports contain sensitive agent data; review the warning before
  downloading them.

After a kill, verify the Activity outcome and pending message state before
re-enabling. A killed or failed iteration may leave a message eligible for
redelivery.

## Event-driven progression

Channels and subscriptions are the advanced layer behind message triggers. They
allow agents and plugins to wake work without polling. Begin with one explicit
subscription and one observable publisher, then add fan-out and groups after
the single-agent delivery lifecycle is understood.

See [Messaging architecture](/docs/architecture/messaging) and [Channel
reference](/docs/reference/channels) for the complete contract.
